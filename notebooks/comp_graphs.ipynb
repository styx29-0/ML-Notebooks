    "### Why Computational Graphs?\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about neural networks in any context, [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) is an important topic to understand because it is the algorithm used for training deep neural networks. \n",
    "在任何情况下讨论神经网络时，反向传播是一个需要理解的重要主题，因为他是用于训练深度神经网络的算法。\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is used to calculate derivatives（导数） which is what you need to keep optimizing parameters of the model and allowing the model to learn on the task at hand. \n",
    "反向传播用于计算导数是保持优化模型的参数和允许模型在手头的任务上学习所需要的\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the deep learning frameworks today like PyTorch does the backpropagation out-of-the-box（开箱即用地） using [**automatic differentiation**](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html). \n",
    "如今许多深度学习框架（如PyTorch）都使用自动微分进行反向传播\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand how this is done it's important to talk about **computational graphs** which defines the flow of computations that are carried out throughout the network. Along the way we will use `torch.autograd` to demonstrate in code how this works. \n",
    "为了更好地理解是如何实现的，讨论这个定义了在整个网络中执行的计算流的计算图非常重要\n",
    "在这个过程中，我们将用代码演示torch.autograd是如何工作的"

    "这不是任何类型的神经网络。我们只是通过一个例非常简单的操作连的例子，你可以用计算图来表示\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's visualize these operations using a computational graph. Computational graphs contain **nodes** which can represent and input (tensor张量, matrix矩阵, vector向量, scalar标量) or **operation** that can be the input to another node. The nodes are connected by **edges**, which represent a function argument, they are pointers to nodes. Note that the computation graphs are directed and acyclic（有向和无环）. The computational graph for our example looks as follows:\n",
